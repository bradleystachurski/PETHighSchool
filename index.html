                        PET-HS is an innovative, student-centered physics curriculum that is designed to engage students in scientific reasoning and follows a guided scientific model-building approach. PET is based on five design principles drawn from sociocultural and cognitive research that allow classrooms to become inclusive learning environments where students develop, share, critique, argue and revise evidence-based ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to engage students in doing science in the classroom and developing scientific principles from evidence. This process of scientific induction provides opportunities for students to engage in discussions involving shared observations, explanations, models, and consensus. In this environment, all students are invited into the learning community and provided an environment to learn. Inclusive learning environments that shift some authority from the instructor to the students can increase student access to science discourse and practices.

                        The PET-HS curriculum engages students in a learning cycle that begins with the elicitation of their initial ideas about a physics concept. Students then collect and interpret laboratory evidence and engage in evidence-based discussions to induce scientific principles. The principles and terminology are formalized in the Scientists' Ideas reading after students grapple with and come to consensus around their evidence-based claims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each PET-HS activity includes the following components: Purpose, Initial Ideas, Collecting and Interpreting Evidence, Summarizing Questions, and Scientist Ideas. Select activities also include a mathematical model building activity.

                    <div class="msg_body" style="display: none;">
                        "PET-HS is very student driven and I didn't have to direct instruct... Students were finding the answers without me telling them. It was much more meaningful and led to greater retention with my students. I saw the confidence in my students grow.  We’d look at the Scientists' Ideas reading and they’d realize ‘oh I had the same idea that this Isaac Newton had. I must be pretty good at this.’  That was incredibly empowering." ~ Becky (Teacher)

                        "The vocabulary was introduced after the phenomenon was examined… they don’t use it [the vocabulary] as a crutch, its more there to support their argument instead of just to throw in the key vocab words” ~ Luke (Student Teacher)

                        "PET-HS gives ownership to students who haven’t had ownership in other science classrooms before.  It empowers them to take charge of their own learning rather than just be fed information.  I think it challenges their analytical skills.  The experiments are authentic and challenge how students analyze things as they go through the learning process and allows them to reflect." ~ Jenni (Teacher)

                        "It's nice to not feel like I’m just feeding students information and they’re just memorizing it... They are becoming better critical thinkers." ~ Kelly (Teacher)

                        "Students establish an understanding of science through learning rather than lecture. In this course we were challenged to reflect on ourselves as learners, debate within groups, discuss as a class, and build models. After class we were asked to reflect on our experiments and the knowledge that we gathered each week. This helped us to critically think about what we were learning in class. As a whole class we would build models, which helped us to understand in depth concepts. By taking each of these different steps we built our knowledge upon a solid framework." ~ Student

                        "This class is very much so set up so that the student is provided the tools to be able to learn the information through their own experimentation. This then empowers the student and raises their confidence because they are finding the answers for themselves. This class also heavily relies on being able to work within a small or large group to be able to discuss and think through different ideas and perspectives while searching for evidence to support the claims being made. The lessons build on each other so that the student its exposed to a piece of information before they know what to do with it and critical thinking and exploration is encouraged." ~ Student

                        "In this class, we built and developed models in order to understand scientific concepts. to build a model, students made claims and backed them up with evidence. each experiment would bring the students one step closer to developing their models and would help them understand the concept by physically doing the experiment. the students then would write down their ideas and share with classmates in order to create a whole class model. students could agree and disagree on certain claims that would be put towards making the actual model. The implementation of models really helped the students to better understand science in this course." ~ Student

                    </div>
                    <p class="msg_head">Describe how scientific terminology is introduced in this course.</p>
                    <div class="msg_body" style="display: none;">
                        "Unlike most classes where the terminology is introduced right off the bat, this class introduces terminology in a new way. In most chapters, the student will being the experiments and learning process without having any knowledge of special terminology. Instead of focusing on a word, the student is focusing on the idea. Then later on in the chapter, the words that go with the focus idea are introduced and the student can easily switch to using that word. This is beneficial to the student because it allows the student to understand the meaning behind a word before introducing a word that may otherwise intimidate the student." ~ Student

                        "In this course, unlike most science courses, the scientific terms and ideas are not just given to you as a definition for you to memorize. We often will start into an activity without any real scientific terminology to describe the results of our experiments. This forces students to come up with their own way of describing and framing the results of each experiment. Once students have worked through an activity, or even a set of activities, we will then be given a "scientist ideas reading." This reading does give students the real terminology and definitions and it also explains the concepts we are investigating in the way that the scientific community has deemed correct." ~ Student

                    </div>
                    <p class="msg_head">How is it that a student knows if a scientific idea is "correct" in this course?</p>
                    <div class="msg_body" style="display: none;">
                        "The main thing is evidence. In our course we must base every single one of our claims on evidence we have either seen or gathered ourselves. This course is not so much focused on "correct" as it is on learning why things are the way that they are. I have never once felt the pressure to have something right in this class, but rather I have felt encouraged to gather evidence to support my claims. The greatest thing is that if my claims are wrong, there is always encouragement to try and gather new evidence or to think of new ideas. This is how learning in the science classroom should be done." ~ Student

                        "If you had asked me this question at the beginning of the semester, I would have told you that the student knows the idea is correct by it being presented in print or verbally. However, we quickly learned that you should never just accept that a scientific idea is correct without evidence. All scientific ideas presented in this class we were given the tools to be able and fully support and provide evidence for. This evidence was then confirmed through Scientist Idea's Readings, class discussions where we could challenges claims and through trying different experiments to see if your evidence could be faulty." ~ Student

                        "A student knows an idea is correct by being able to back it up with evidence and a model. None of the models are created without the use of evidence, so the students can develop the concept themselves. The class model that is developed is generally one that is agreed upon by the whole class. This solidifies the model because many people agree and observed the same evidence. Once the class understands the model, further reading to ensure the model is correct is given." ~ Student
